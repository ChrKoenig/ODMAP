"Overview","Hyptheses","Hypotheses","shrike abundance is strongly affected by landscape composition, requiring a mix of hedges for perching and open grassland for hunting; the species is widespread, if not abundant, in Eurasia, without obvious associations to climate"
"Overview","Assumptions","Model assumptions","Implicitly, we assume that sampling is homogeneous or related to distance to settlements (which is one of our predictors); for projections, we assume that the current distribution’s delimiting factors will also form the niche of the species in the future; that we have included all species-relevant predictors that are likely to change in the future"
"Overview","Algorithms","Modelling techniques","glm; gam; ann"
"Overview","Algorithms","Model complexity","Non-linear and interacting predictors to allow for more realistic cause-effect representation. Model selection to reduce predictive variance; virtual species analysis and randomisation of data analysis to explore the probability of creating spurious results due to the flexible algorithms."
"Overview","Algorithms","Model averaging","No model averaging/ensemble modelling. We explicitly quantified uncertainty introduced in various steps of an SDM analysis."
"Overview","Workflow","Model workflow","We tried to always use three variations for every step of the analysis: three data qualities (b, c, d; see Data section), three collinearity methods (none, PCA, sequential regression), three variable selection approaches (stepAIC, best subset AIC, AIC with >20 records per variable), three SDM algorithms (GLM, GAM and ANN), three climate scenarios (A1B, A2 and B2) and three rainfall realisations (wet, normal, dry), as to directly be able to compare their contribution to the overall prediction uncertainty. We combined all levels of the 4 factors of our analysis, yielding 81 models; each model was 5-fold cross-validated (randomly selected); mean CV-AUC is the measure of model quality; each model then predicts to each of the 9 scenario realisations, yielding 729 projections of probability of occurrence for each cell. The workflow is also depicted in Fig. 2 in the paper."
