Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,none
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"GAMs were first parameterized using all environmental and spatial variables, and smoothing splines, to assess the validity of the linear model for each bivariate relationship, and to explore the shape of the response curve and strength of the relationship between each species and explanatory variable. Then, GLMs were parameterized using all variables and using response functions suggested by the GAM."

Model,Variable pre-selection,Variable pre-selection,"Because there is a body of literature and theory linking bioclimatic gradients to plant distributions, and because the models are intended to be predictive rather than exploratory, explanatory variables were chosen a priori."
Model,Multicollinearity,Multicollinearity,"I excluded highly correlated variables based on ecological plausibility. For example, the deviation of the coldest temperature from the annual mean was also examined, but was strongly correlated with jul.maxt. Also, quarterly estimates of solar radiation for the growing season (spring: Mar-May), and driest quarter (summer: Jun-Aug) were highly correlated (r = 0.88), and therefore only winter (Dec-Feb) and spring values were used in modeling."

Then the tree was pruned inter- actively to the smallest size possible without increasing model error.)"

Model,Analysis and Correction of non-independence,Spatial autocorrelation,"Model residuals were not explicitly tested for spatial dependence. I developed models both with and without geographic coordinates as explanatory variables. This addresses geographic patterning but not spatial dependence or clustering in the dataset. Because of strong clustering of some species among the sample plots, spatial variables accounted for large proportions of the explained deviance in some GAMs and GLMs. However, CT-models that included spatial variables only accounted for a small increase in prediction accuracy over those that did not."

Model,Threshold selection,Threshold selection,"I chose an optimum threshold value of p that minimizes omission and commission errors. This is important because when a species is rare in the sample, a ‘model’ that predicted it to be absent everywhere would have high overall accuracy (but high omission error), and vice versa"
Assessment,Performance statistics,Performance on training data,True negative rate; True positive rate; False negative rate; False positive rate; Performance statistics were only estimated on training data. The model fit and significance of the variables were evaluated using the residual deviance. [Austin et al.] suggest deleting observations that are beyond the last positive observation by greater than 1% of the sample; sorted by an important environmental variable. I included the last positive observation +/–10% of the sample; and so the fit of my models may still be overestimated somewhat. The models were also assessed by examining the number of observations (presence/absence) correctly predicted by each model; as well as the proportion of omission (type I) and commission (type II) errors – predicting the species to be absent when it is present; and vice versa.
