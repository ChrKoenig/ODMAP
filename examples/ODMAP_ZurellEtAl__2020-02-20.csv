"Overview","Hyptheses","Hypotheses","Based on previous studies, we tested climate, topography and vegetation structure as important environmental predictor variables for bird and tree species in Switzerland in an exploratory way."
"Overview","Assumptions","Model assumptions","We assumed that species are at pseudo-equilibrium with the environment. Also, we assumed that detection errors were negligible. Previous analyses of the Swiss breeding bird data have shown that the sampling approach ensures high species detectability of approximately 90% (Kéry & Schmid, 2006). In the forest inventory, tree individuals below a certain diameter at breast height are not recorded and we assume that this procedure does not bias the species identification."

"Overview","Workflow","Model workflow","Prior to model building, all predictor variables were standardised. In each model, we only included the five most important and weakly correlated variables. Univariate variable importance for each predictor was assessed in a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation design. Ensemble predictions from SDMs and richness models were derived using un-weighted ensemble means. Predictive model performance was assessed using a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation."

"Data","Biodiversity data","Sampling design","Bird atlas data were recorded over a four-year period (1993-1996) in usually three visits per year (two above the treeline) using a simplified territory mapping approach. The NFI samples Switzerland on a regular grid (spacing 1.4 km), and in case the sample falls into forest it records forest characteristics in a maximal area of 50x50 m (Brassel & Lischke, 2001)."

"Data","Biodiversity data","Absence data","The Swiss breeding bird atlas and the NFI contains presence and absence data. In the Swiss breeding bird data, species are listed as absent in a site if they were not encountered within the 2-3 visits per breeding season in the four successive years of recording. Previous analyses have shown that this sampling approach ensures high species detectability of approximately 90% (Kéry & Schmid, 2006). In the NFI plots, all tree and bush individuals above a certain diameter at breast height are recorded. We have no information about potential species biases in unrecorded small trees and bushes."

"Data","Predictor variables","Data processing","- Topography: Slope, aspect, TPI and TWI (Wilson & Gallant, 2000) were based on a 100 m digital elevation model. TPI in a cell corresponds to the difference of the focal cell to the mean of its eight surrounding cells, with negative values indicating a depression,  positive values a rise. Potential monthly solar radiation was calculated following Hofierka et al. (2002). 
- Climate: Monthly average climate data for the period 1981-1990 were generated by interpolating ca. 300 MeteoSwiss station data to a resolution of 100x100m using the Daymet software (Thornton et al., 1997). From these, we derived 19 bioclimatic predictors (http://worldclim.org/bioclim) as well as so-called degree days. Degree days constitute the sum of all monthly temperature values greater than a given threshold temperature multiplied by the total number of days (with thresholds 0°C and 5°C for DDEG0 and DDEG5). We calculated PET using radiation as proposed by Makkink (1957), as this method was shown to best approximate PET in Switzerland (Xu & Singh, 2002). For precipitation and PET we calculated summer (April to September) and winter (October to March) averages as well as their ratio. We calculated the MBAL as the difference between precipitation and PET, and MIND as the ratio between PET and precipitation. For the analyses of forest bird species, the topographic and climatic data were aggregated to 1x1 km grids using the mean as aggregate-function such that the grid cell-size matched the bird survey data.
- Vertical vegetation structure: LiDAR-derived data was processed with the LAStools software (Isenburg, 2015). The Swiss-wide LiDAR dataset consists of discrete first and last pulse returns with a nominal footprint of 0.3 m and a point density of 0.5 points/m2 (Artuso et al., 2003). LiDAR variables were generated separately as raster datasets for both the 100x100 m grid that matches the tree species NFI data, as well as the 1x1 km grid that matches the bird survey data. From the terrain corrected and classified LiDAR point cloud (heights of classified vegetation LiDAR returns minus interpolated DTM heights), we calculated the average height, their standard deviation and coefficient of variation as well as the corresponding 10th, 25th and 95th percentiles per 100 m and 1 km pixel, respectively. In addition, we also derived the canopy cover (percentage of first returns above 1m; COV) and canopy density (ratio of all returns above 1m divided by all returns; DNS). We further calculated both standard deviation and coefficient of variation in order to characterize vertical variation in LiDAR returns. In addition, we estimated the so-called foliage height diversity (FHD), which is the Shannon diversity index based on 5m vertical bins as H = pi ln(pi), where pi is the proportion of LiDAR returns in the 5m bin i. Additionally, we calculated understory height diversity (UHD) for the 1x1 km grid as we considered these important predictors for bird distributions in Swiss forests. UHD was derived analogously to FHD but using 1m bins restricted to below 12m (Zellweger et al., 2016) as well as the ratio between the 95th and 25th percentile.
- Horizontal vegetation structure: For the bird data at 1x1 km resolution, we derived LiDAR variables accounting for edge effects and fragmentation in order to describe the horizontal structural heterogeneity of the vegetation (Zellweger et al., 2013). Based on the terrain corrected LiDAR point cloud we generated a gridded Canopy Height Model (CHM) with a grid size of 20 m. The CHM was classified into three classes, which are non-forest (vegetation height < 1m), understory/midstory (1 – 12m) and canopy (> 12m). The length of edges between two height classes (e.g. non-forest/canopy) was calculated for each grid cell and summed up for the 1x1 km grid of the bird survey data. To measure the spatial dispersion or aggregation of the vegetation height classes understory/midstory and canopy, a clumpiness index was calculated for the 1x1 km grid using the software FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al., 2012).
- Because the forest bird data were recorded 1993-1996 and the LiDAR data were recorded after 2000, there is a temporal mismatch between species data and vegetation data. Generally, the forest laws in Switzerland are very strict and we can, thus, rule out any major changes in the vegetation structure between these two periods.  The main exception is storm damage due to the cyclone “Lothar” in 1999. In storm-damaged sites we can expect differences in vegetation structure between the recording periods of the bird survey data (before the cyclone) and the LiDAR data (after the cyclone). Hence, we removed all storm-damaged sites (n=10) from the analyses to avoid mismatches in vegetation structure."

"Model","Multicollinearity","Multicollinearity","We reduced the predictor set to variables with bivariate Spearman correlations |r|<0.7, retaining those variables from highly correlated pairs with higher cross-validated univariate importance (Dormann et al., 2013).  Univariate variable importance for each predictor was assessed in a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation design by estimating univariate GAMs on 4 of 5 folds (with logit link for species occurrences and log link for species richness) and cross-predicting these to the left-out fold with 5 repetitions. From the cross-predictions, we calculated the percentage of explained deviance. We thus obtained a predictor ranking for each single species and removed the less important variables from pairs of highly correlated variables. However, JSDMs require a global set of predictor variables and we thus selected those five variables with highest mean cross-validated univariate importance among all species. SDMs and richness models were run with the same set of global predictors as in JSDMs.  In a sensitivity analysis we additionally estimated SDMs and richness models using the five most important variables selected individually for each species and species richness, respectively. This did not change the overall results."
