Overview,Hyptheses,Hypotheses,"Based on previous studies, we tested climate, topography and vegetation structure as important environmental predictor variables for bird and tree species in Switzerland in an exploratory way."
Overview,Assumptions,Model assumptions,"We assumed that species are at pseudo-equilibrium with the environment. Also, we assumed that detection errors were negligible. Previous analyses of the Swiss breeding bird data have shown that the sampling approach ensures high species detectability of approximately 90% (Kéry & Schmid, 2006). In the forest inventory, tree individuals below a certain diameter at breast height are not recorded and we assume that this procedure does not bias the species identification."
Overview,Algorithms,Modelling techniques,glm; gam; brt; randomForest; JSDM
Overview,Algorithms,Model complexity,"Model settings were chosen to yield intermediately complex response surfaces. We allowed quadratic relationships in GLMs and JSDMs, and restricted GAMs, BRTs and RFs such that these would not overfit too much."
Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,We combined the four SDMs to ensemble SDM predictions.
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"Prior to model building, all predictor variables were standardised. In each model, we only included the five most important and weakly correlated variables. Univariate variable importance for each predictor was assessed in a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation design. Ensemble predictions from SDMs and richness models were derived using un-weighted ensemble means. Predictive model performance was assessed using a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation."
Overview,Software,Software,"All analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.2 (R Core Team, 2016) with packages sperrorest (Brenning, 2012), mgcv (Wood, 2011), gbm (Ridgeway, 2013), dismo (Hijmans et al., 2017), randomForest (Liaw & Wiener, 2002), boral (Hui, 2016), ncf (Bjornstad, 2016), PresenceAbsence (Freeman & Moisen, 2008), ecospat (Broennimann et al., 2016) and lme4 (Bates et al., 2015)."

Overview,Software,Data availability,Data are available from Dryad (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k88v330).

Data,Biodiversity data,Data sources,"Bird presence-absence data at a 1x1 km spatial resolution were obtained from the Swiss breeding bird atlas (Schmid et al., 1998). Tree species presence-absence data were obtained from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI)."
Data,Biodiversity data,Sampling design,"Bird atlas data were recorded over a four-year period (1993-1996) in usually three visits per year (two above the treeline) using a simplified territory mapping approach. The NFI samples Switzerland on a regular grid (spacing 1.4 km), and in case the sample falls into forest it records forest characteristics in a maximal area of 50x50 m (Brassel & Lischke, 2001)."
Data,Biodiversity data,Sample size,The bird data set contained 2535 1x1 km cells with a total number of 56 forest bird species and prevalence ranging 0.03-0.73.  The tree data set contained 6946 100x100 m cells with a total number of 63 tree and shrub species and prevalence ranging 0.01-0.79.
Data,Biodiversity data,Clipping,We clipped all data to the political boundary of Switzerland.
Data,Biodiversity data,Scaling,We aggregated the NFI presence-absence data to 100x100 m plot size to match the minimum spatial grain of available environmental data.
Data,Biodiversity data,Cleaning,We only considered species with at least 50 presences.
Data,Biodiversity data,Absence data,"The Swiss breeding bird atlas and the NFI contains presence and absence data. In the Swiss breeding bird data, species are listed as absent in a site if they were not encountered within the 2-3 visits per breeding season in the four successive years of recording. Previous analyses have shown that this sampling approach ensures high species detectability of approximately 90% (Kéry & Schmid, 2006). In the NFI plots, all tree and bush individuals above a certain diameter at breast height are recorded. We have no information about potential species biases in unrecorded small trees and bushes."

Data,Data partitioning,Training data,We randomly selected 70% of data (1774 cells for birds and 4862 for tree species) for model building .
Data,Data partitioning,Validation data,"Predictive model performance for single species was assessed using a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation design. Therefore, for each dataset we split the study region into five rectangular tiles (R package “sperrorest”). The resulting sample sizes per tile ranged 222-568 cells for forest birds and 570-1440 cells for tree species."
Data,Data partitioning,Test data,We left 30% of the data (761 cells for birds and 2084 cells for tree species) for independent validation of the community predictions.

Model,Variable pre-selection,Variable pre-selection,"In each model, we only included the five most important and weakly correlated variables obtained from the cross-validated univariate variable importance."
Model,Multicollinearity,Multicollinearity,"We reduced the predictor set to variables with bivariate Spearman correlations |r|<0.7, retaining those variables from highly correlated pairs with higher cross-validated univariate importance (Dormann et al., 2013).  Univariate variable importance for each predictor was assessed in a 5-fold spatial block cross-validation design by estimating univariate GAMs on 4 of 5 folds (with logit link for species occurrences and log link for species richness) and cross-predicting these to the left-out fold with 5 repetitions. From the cross-predictions, we calculated the percentage of explained deviance. We thus obtained a predictor ranking for each single species and removed the less important variables from pairs of highly correlated variables. However, JSDMs require a global set of predictor variables and we thus selected those five variables with highest mean cross-validated univariate importance among all species. SDMs and richness models were run with the same set of global predictors as in JSDMs.  In a sensitivity analysis we additionally estimated SDMs and richness models using the five most important variables selected individually for each species and species richness, respectively. This did not change the overall results."
