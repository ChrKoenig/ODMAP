Overview,Hyptheses,Hypotheses,"Based on previous studies, we selected climate and vegetation structure as important environmental predictor variables related to the large-scale distribution of birds in breeding and wintering areas. Mean temperatures in breeding (April to August) and wintering (December to February) ranges were selected because small birds avoid cold areas to limit excessive thermoregulatory costs (Calder and King 1974). We also included mean precipitation in breeding and wintering grounds. Precipitation improves primary productivity in wintering grounds after the Mediterranean summer (Nahal 1981), thus increasing the carrying capacity for wintering birds (Carrascal and Palomino 2012, Teller<ed>a et al. 2014b). However, in temperate areas, higher precipitation has been related to poor breeding success. Thus, it can be suggested that the moistest sectors will be suboptimal areas for breeding (e.g. <d6>berg et al. 2015). We also included the annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a surrogate of primary productivity and, according to the strong effect of vegetation cover on passerine distribution (Wiens 1989), we included woody cover (Di Miceli et al.2011). Finally, we considered the effect of two different variables related to the seasonal pulses of productivity tracked by migratory birds in breeding and wintering grounds (Wisz et al. 2007,Engler et al. 2014). We used precipitation seasonality as a surrogate for the rain-mediated productive pulses in Mediterranean wintering grounds and temperature seasonality as a surrogate of the productive output in central and northern European summer grounds."
Overview,Assumptions,Model assumptions,"#1: Relevant ecological drivers (or proxies) of species distributions are included.

 #2: Detectability does not change across habitat gradients.

 #3: Species are at equilibrium with their environment.

 #4: Sampling is adequate and representative (and any biases are accounted for/corrected)."

Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"Prior to model building, all predictor variables were standardised and used variance inflation (VIF) analysis to avoid highly correlated variables. We only included the five most important and weakly correlated variables per season.
Univariate variable importance for each predictor was assessed with jackknife analyses of the regularised gain with training data.
Predictive model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation."

Data,Biodiversity data,Scaling,Duplicate records in the same localities (e.g. ringing stations) were removed and spatial autocorrelation was minimised by randomly removing occurrences within 5 km of each other.
Data,Biodiversity data,Cleaning,"We used individuals with first-encounter records refer to the initial encounter with an individual when it was first ringed in breeding (April to August) or wintering (December to February). Recoveries in wintering (December to February) or breeding (April to August), respectively, comprise all dead (including sick and dying) encounters, live recaptures away from the ringing place (nearly all by qualified ringers), and live resightings away from the ringing place (mainly by ringers and other birdwatchers)."

Data,Biodiversity data,Background data,random selection of background points in the minimum convex polygon (convex hull) produced by the full set of ringing records.
Data,Biodiversity data,Errors and biases,"Error rates deemed low, as volunteers were highly trained and the individual is identified twice (first encounter and recovery) independently. However, the background selection was weighted using a bias grid reflecting human footprint (HFP), an index of population density, land transformation and road density (Sanderson et al. 2002). We used HFP as a bias grid because the mean human footprint per country is positively related to the density of all ringing recoveries reported per country (r = 0.53, P = 0.036, n = 16), a plain index of the effort applied to control ringed birds (Appendix S1)."
