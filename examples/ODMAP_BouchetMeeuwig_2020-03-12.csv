Overview,Hypotheses,Hypotheses,"There is increasing evidence that complex seabed features influence the distribution of marine vertebrates. We used measures of seabed depth, curvature, slope, rugosity, and topographic complexity as predictor variables for fishes and sharks. We also tested sea surface temperature (and its variance)."
Overview,Assumptions,Model assumptions,"•	 Relevant ecological drivers (or proxies) of species distributions are included.
•	Detectability does not change across transects or habitat gradients.
•	Species are at (pseudo-) equilibrium with their environment.
•	Species show largely similar responses to the bait and the sampling instrument.
•	Sampling is adequate and representative (and any biases are accounted for/corrected).

Overview,Algorithms,Modelling techniques,maxent; occupancy
Overview,Algorithms,Model complexity,MaxEnt models were built with linear and quadratic features only. Occupancy models only included linear terms (no interactions).
Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,We combined both model types to form ensemble predictions.
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"Only weakly correlated predictors were retained in the analysis. We performed parameter tuning for the regularisation parameter (b) in MaxEnt models based on AICc, using the ENMTools package. We tested b values from 1 to 10 (in increments of one). Ensemble predictions were derived using weighted means, with weights given by the models’ average True Skill Statistic (TSS) evaluated over 50 Bootstrap replicates of the data."
Overview,Software,Software,"Analyses were conducted in R version 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2016) and MaxEnt v3.3.3 (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/)."

Data,Predictor variables,Data sources,Predictors were derived from a national bathymetric grid produced and curated by Geoscience Australia. Remote-sensed sea surface temperature data were obtained from NASA’s Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR). All data are freely available.

Model,Variable pre-selection,Variable pre-selection,The choice of initial covariates was made as a compromise between their availability and their ecological relevance as indirect proxy of species distributions. Only weakly correlated covariates were included in each model.
Model,Multicollinearity,Multicollinearity,"Multicollinearity between predictors was investigated using variance inflation factors and Spearman rank correlation coefficients. When variables were strongly related (|rs| > 0.5 and/or VIF > 2), we only retained one from each pair to minimize the possibility of over-fitting."

Model,Model selection - model averaging - ensembles,Model averaging,"We took an information-theoretic approach to model averaging for each model class, considering all combinations of covariates. Within model classes, candidate models were ranked based on their AICc scores, with models within three units of lowest-AICc model retained and averaged according to their corresponding Akaike weights. Consensus predictions were then obtained across model classes using weighted ensemble means. "
